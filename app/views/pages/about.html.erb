<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	<%= link_to "One Month Rails", "http://onemonthrails.com" %>
	is a project to teach 
	<%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org" %>
	in one month. This is the application I developed as my project for that class.
</p>

<p>A gear swap site for friends to trade kayaking gear. Users can upload photos and descriptions of gear they are willing to swap/loan or sell to others on this site.</p>

<p>I am working on implementing a "club" feature which will allow users to join/create a kayaking club where they can see the gear that is only shared within that club. This will allow smaller groups of friends or those in a certain locality to trade more easily.</p>
